## Hi there 👋
I’m [Dima](https://t.me/dmitriykutyrev), a programmer from Russia.

I love designing and creating whatever I can imagine.

If I come up with something interesting, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tool right now is Java and IntelliJ IDEA. I also have huge respect for planning tools like Notion and Obsidian, though I often use Google Docs because it's simpler.

I don’t have many repositories yet, as I’m still new to GitHub.

You can find me on Telegram under [@dmitriykutyrev](https://t.me/dmitriykutyrev).
